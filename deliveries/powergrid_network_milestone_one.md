**Context**

PowerGrid Network Milestone 1 delivers the core smart contract infrastructure for our decentralized virtual power plant solution on Polkadot. This milestone establishes the fundamental blockchain layer that enables device registration, grid event coordination, token-based rewards, and decentralized governance. These smart contracts form the foundation for coordinating thousands of smart home devices to provide grid services while incentivizing user participation through our $PWGD token economy.

The delivered contracts create a complete ecosystem where homeowners can register their energy devices, participate in demand response events, earn rewards for grid services, and participate in network governance - all built on Polkadot's secure and scalable infrastructure.

**Additional Information**

**Development Status**: Milestone 1 is complete and production-ready. All smart contracts have been built, tested, and optimized for deployment. The codebase includes comprehensive documentation, automated testing, and deployment scripts.

**Next Steps**: Milestone 2 will focus on smart device integration, connecting real hardware (smart plugs/sensors) to the blockchain infrastructure delivered in Milestone 1.

**Repository Status**: The main branch contains the complete Milestone 1 deliverables with commit hash `[latest-commit-hash]` representing the final delivery state.

**Testing**: All 14 unit tests pass successfully, covering device registration, grid event participation, token operations, and governance workflows. The test suite can be executed with `./scripts/test-all.sh` in the repository root.

**Build System**: Complete build automation is provided with optimized WASM compilation, comprehensive error handling, and development environment setup scripts.



## ðŸ”¬ How to Test Milestone 1

To reproduce the results of Milestone 1 on a clean Linux environment:

1. **Run setup script** (installs Rust, wasm target, cargo-contract v5.0.1, substrate-contracts-node):
   ```bash
   ./scripts/setup.sh
   ```

2. **Start a local Substrate contracts node** in a separate terminal:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/run-node.sh
   ```

3. **Build all contracts**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/build-all.sh
   ```

4. **Run all unit and integration tests**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/test-all.sh
   ```

If all steps succeed, you should see:
- Optimized WASM artifacts generated in `target/ink/<contract_name>/`
- âœ… Build success messages for each contract
- âœ… Test results showing all 14 unit tests and 5 integration tests passing
