**Context** (optional)

Milestone 1 focuses on establishing the foundational infrastructure and core functionality of the proctoring system. The signaling server, built using Actix-Web, provides the essential communication layer for managing WebRTC session initiation and coordination between peers. The SFU media routing module, implemented with webrtc, enables efficient real-time handling of audio and video streams, ensuring scalability and performance during multi-user sessions.

Additionally, a basic React-based frontend integration was developed to demonstrate real-time video streaming and connection flow, serving as the initial interface for the proctoring systemâ€™s user experience. Together, these deliverables establish a working prototype that connects backend signaling and SFU components with a functional frontend interface.
