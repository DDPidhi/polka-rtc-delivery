# Polkadot Open Source Developer Grants Bounty Milestone Delivery <!-- omit in toc -->

## Milestone Delivery Process

The milestone delivery process is part of the [Polkadot Open Source Developer Grants Bounty](https://github.com/PolkadotOpenSourceGrants). You can find the application process [here](https://github.com/PolkadotOpenSourceGrants/apply).  

:warning: Before you submit a milestone, make sure it complies with our [Delivery Guidelines](delivery-guidelines.md).

1. **Milestone Delivery:**
   1. [Fork](https://github.com/PolkadotOpenSourceGrants/delivery/fork) this repository with the **same GitHub account** that you used to submit the application.
   2. In the newly created fork, create a copy of the milestone delivery template ([`deliveries/milestone-delivery-template.md`](deliveries/milestone-delivery-template.md)). Make sure you **do not modify the template file directly**. 
   5. Fill out the template with the details of your milestone, including all deliverables as listed in your application.
   4. Name the file `project_name-milestone_number.md`.
   6. Create a pull request and fill out the PR template.
2. **Milestone Review:**
   1. [The curators](https://github.com/PolkadotOpenSourceGrants#curators) can (and usually do) issue comments and request changes on the pull request. Their feedback needs to be resolved before your milestone is accepted.
   2. If everything is according to spec, they will merge your pull request to accept the delivery.
