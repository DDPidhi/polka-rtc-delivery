## üèÅ Milestone Delivery Process

The milestone delivery process is part of the [Polkadot Fast-Grants Programme](https://github.com/Polkadot-Fast-Grants/). You can find the application process [here](https://github.com/Polkadot-Fast-Grants/apply).  

‚ö†Ô∏è Before you submit a milestone, make sure it complies with our [delivery guidelines](`deliveries/delivery-guidelines.md`).

1. **Milestone Delivery:** üì§
   1. [Fork]([https://github.com/PolkadotFastGrants/delivery/fork](https://github.com/Polkadot-Fast-Grants/delivery/fork)) this repository with the **same GitHub account** that you used to submit the application.
   2. In the newly created fork, create a copy of the milestone delivery template ([`deliveries/milestone-delivery-template.md`](deliveries/milestone-delivery-template.md)). Make sure you **do not modify the template file directly**. 
   3. Fill out the template with the details of your milestone, including all deliverables as listed in your application.
   4. Name the file `project_name-milestone_number.md`.
   5. Create a pull request and fill out the PR template.
2. **Milestone Review:** üîç
   1. [The curators](https://github.com/Polkadot-Fast-Grants/apply#curators) can (and usually do) issue comments and request changes on the pull request. Their feedback needs to be resolved before your milestone is accepted.
   2. Milestone evaluation will be completed within 14 days.
   3. If a milestone is not accepted, you will get one chance to fix the deficiencies and resubmit the milestone within 14 days.
   4. If everything is according to spec, they will merge your pull request to accept the delivery.
   5. Payments will only be made after successful milestone delivery.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Important Timeframes

- Each milestone is capped at **$5,000 USD**.
- Milestones must be delivered within 3 months, or they will be considered undelivered by default.
- Partial delivery of milestones is not acceptable.
- Milestone evaluation will be completed within 14 days.
